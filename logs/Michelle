## Labs
Lab 1:
* Linux wouldn’t bootload on my laptop, so I used Colabatory/worked with Karina for later labs until getting a computer that works with Linux

#### Lab 2
* Used Colabatory to implement line detection
* Improvements added after: Skip every other pixel to speed up pixel counting; adjust segment of view where pixels are counted; learned that list comprehension is much faster than while loops, so reimplemented line detection with list comprehension

#### Lab 3
* Worked with Karina since laptop didn’t run Linux
* Implemented line tracking from lab 2 and integrated with PID control
* Improvements added after: Using list comprehension in as many places as possible; restructured method to be cleaner and faste

#### Lab 4:
* Implemented recognition of Vector cube based on tutorial for SIFT. Learned to use the anki_vector library to control Anki 
* Improvement added after: Rearranging classes and methods to be implemented properly
* Debugged many computer issues to work with anki, wifi, linux, etc.

#### Lab 5:
* Implemented neural network based on the provided example. 
* Improvements added after: List comprehension to speed up operation; with Miti’s help and recommendation used pandas for confusion matrix instead instead of just a matrix

#### Lab 6:
* Implemented line-following and used Q-learning. Was able to improve performance of robot by punishing robot for oscillating repeatedly (when stuff in corners) and by adjusting behavior when it starts to drift from line

## Final Project
#### Mar. 3, 2020
* Setup software/file structure architecture
* Updated neural network from lab 5 to save the training model for license plate reading in h5 and json files
* Implemented crosswalk detection for Anki in-real

#### Mar. 12, 2020
* Retrained license plate reader using plated with blank background (instead of BC license plate background)
* Added lane detection
* Implemented PID

#### Apr. 5, 2020
* Updated crosswalk detection and lane detection to work with simulation instead of Anki in-real

#### Apr. 12, 2020
* Redesigned PID algorithm to work with simulation
* Improved algorithms with pixel-counting using list comprehension instead of while loops to reduce latency

#### Apr. 13, 2020
* Tuned PID
* Added compensation for crosswalk (crosswalk skews PID control/lane detection)
* Merge with Karina’s license plate reader

#### Apr. 14, 2020
* Added corner detection
* Added test script stop.py
* Updated crosswalk algorithms to detect exact location where robot should stop
* Tuned PID 

#### Apr. 15, 2020
* Cleaned up repo
* Refactored to use constants.py file more
* Uploaded results from video and “final” run v.1
* Made all paths relative instead of absolute

#### Apr. 18. 2020
* Implemented new crosswalk corner check and tuned PID so that robot crosses second crosswalk
